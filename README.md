<h1> <strong> YOLO for Traffic Sign Detection </strong> </h1>

<p>
    This document provides a technical overview and implementation guide for the YOLOv1 detection subsystem, developed as my primary contribution to the Applied Informatics group project on traffic sign recognition.
</p>

<p>
    The scope of this README is exclusively limited to the YOLO component, which functions as the core computer vision engine for our team's larger system. My responsibility encompassed the complete pipeline for this module:
    
<ul>
  <li> The adaptation and configuration of the YOLOv1 architecture. </li>
  <li> Model training and hyperparameter tuning. </li>
  <li> The final implementation script that provides an API for the main application. </li>
</ul>
</p>
    
<p>
    This component's primary function is to ingest a video frame and output a vector of bounding box coordinates, class labels, and confidence scores for any detected traffic signs.
</p>

<p>
    The subsequent sections provide a detailed delineation of each implemented module.
